						<h1>Technical Report </h1>
					</header>

					<h2>Project Overview</h2>
					<p>My first software project was a personal portfolio website, created as part of my final web
						development assignment. This project was a significant milestone in my learning journey as a
						software engineering student, allowing me to apply my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in
						a practical setting. The main goal of this website was to introduce myself professionally,
						showcase my work, and experiment with fundamental web development concepts.</p>
					<h2>Design and Features</h2>
					<p>The website's design and layout were intentionally kept simple and consistent across all pages. I
						chose a colour scheme consisting of <span class="highlight">dark red, black, grey, and
							white</span> to give the website a bold yet professional appearance. The navigation bar was
						placed at the top of the page to enhance usability and provide a sleek design. Additionally, I
						included an aside section featuring three social media iconsâ€”Indeed, Instagram, and GitHub.
						Clicking on any of these icons would redirect the user to the corresponding platform,
						demonstrating my ability to integrate hyperlinks effectively.</p>
					<h3>Dropdown Menus and Layout</h3>
					<p>One of the key features of the website was the <span class="highlight">dropdown menu</span>
						incorporated into the navigation links. This was implemented using HTML and CSS to provide an
						organised and accessible way to navigate different sections of the site. Another design choice I
						made was to use <span class="highlight">columns</span> on two of the pages to display text. This
						was done to show versatility in text presentation and layout structuring. By experimenting with
						different text arrangements, I was able to demonstrate my understanding of CSS layout techniques
						such as flexbox and grid.</p>
					<h2>Development Process</h2>
					<p>From a coding perspective, the project was relatively straightforward. HTML and CSS concepts were
						easy for me to grasp, and the process of implementing the design elements was smooth. However, I
						encountered some challenges, particularly in ensuring consistency across different screen sizes.
						To address this, I implemented <span class="highlight">media queries</span>, creating separate
						stylesheets for mobile and laptop screens. This helped improve the website's responsiveness,
						ensuring a better user experience across various devices.</p>
					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>Looking back, this project was a great learning experience that laid the foundation for my web
						development skills. It not only reinforced my understanding of front-end technologies but also
						encouraged me to explore more advanced concepts such as JavaScript interactivity, backend
						integration, and database management. Overall, this website reflected my personality through its
						design choices while serving as a testament to my growing skills in web development.</p>
