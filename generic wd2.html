						<h1>Web Game Development: Project Review </h1>
					</header>

					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>Hello, this is the evaluation for my project for AS2. The objective for this project is as
						follows: The purpose of this assignment is to assess the ability to create an interactive web
						page using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The brief was to make a game where the player should avoid
						the bombs from the tanks. The game should randomly create tanks at the right-hand side of the
						screen, and they should shoot bombs that go across the screen towards the player. When the bomb
						hits the edge of the screen, it should explode. I have completed the checklist to the best of my
						ability.</p>

					<h2>Basic Features</h2>
					<p>The game begins once the button is pressed, and the button also disappears once the game begins.
						The tanks and bombs are created in random positions and are randomized throughout the game.
						While this is happening, the bombs move across the screen from right to left. Multiple bombs can
						move across the screen at once. The bombs do explode with an animation if they hit the player
						(displaying player and explosion collision) or reach the end of the window. If the player is hit
						enough times, a dying animation is displayed, and a game-over message appears on a button.
						Additionally, there is cactus collision, meaning the player will bump into a cactus.</p>

					<h2>Additional Features</h2>
					<p>The bombs explode at random points, not all at the same time, and the explosion animation
						disappears after three seconds. An attempt was made to add and remove lives in the project using
						the following code:</p>
					<pre>
    function setupLives() {
        lives = defaultLives;
        var ul = document.getElementsByClassName('health')[0];
        ul.innerHTML = '';
        for (let index = 0; index < lives; index++) {
            createLives();
        }
    }
</pre>
					<p>However, this was unsuccessful. Additionally, a hit animation was not implemented. A game-over
						message does appear if the player is hit three times, and a try again button appears when the
						player dies, providing an opportunity to try again.</p>

					<h2>Scoring System</h2>
					<p>A scoring system is in place, along with a place to enter a name. However, the issue is that it
						does not save to local storage, so refreshing the page causes the data to disappear and the high
						score to be lost. Another issue is that if the game is retried, the counter restarts and
						continues simultaneously. The bombs move across the page at random speeds, and an attempt was
						made to implement different angles using the following code:</p>
					<pre>
    var top = bomb.offsetTop;
    var left = bomb.offsetLeft;
    if (top > random) {
        if (angleNum == 2) {
            left = left + degree;
        }
        if (angleNum == 3) {
            left = left - degree;
        }
        bomb.style.top = top + 'px';
        bomb.style.left = left + 'px';
    }
</pre>
					<p>However, this was unsuccessful.</p>

					<h2>Highest Criteria Achieved</h2>
					<p>One task from the highest criteria was completed: The player displays the "fire" animation when
						the space key is pressed, but instead of fire appearing, a bow appears.</p>

					<h2>Issues and Future Improvements</h2>
					<p>There are a couple of bugs in the game. When clicking "try again," the player vibrates for a few
						seconds before starting again, and the timer becomes glitchy. Overall, the project went well. If
						it were to be done again, implementing lives, a hit animation, and weapons for the player would
						be priorities. Additionally, levels would be added to make the game more interactive. If the
						same game were to be recreated, everything would be sped up, as the current pace feels too slow.
